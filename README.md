Final Project

### Scientific Question:
The NOAA ESRL Global Monitoring Division has data from monitoring towers and flights of various atmospheric gas species in the atmosphere including carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, and carbonyl sulfide at various locations around the world. This project will look into two tower locations in Barrow, Alaska and Alert, Canada, and one flight study in East Trout Lake, Canada. The purpose is to look at the total magnitude of OCS uptake in the column. There will be a time series analysis of aircraft data as well as spatial map of the locations of the towers and flight. The final results will include a map of the locations of the monitoring sites, and vertical column descriptions of OCS, CO2, CH4, and CO. 

The data is customized from the NOAA ESRL Global Monitoring Division website accessible at: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/data/

The data will be included in files on the GitHub repository. Please email the author, Emily Follansbee at erf2154@columbia.edu for access to the Google Drive directory.
